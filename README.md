# Second-Hand-Car-Selling-System
This repo contains project I developed using Core Java concepts for Second Hand Car Selling System (SHCSS). SHCSS applies Core Java Concepts like Inheritance, Abstraction, Interfaces and many more.
My SHCSS is helpful for vendors/agents to handle customer details, car details, car owner details,
Payment data including types of payment like EMI, Cash, Cheque, Card and profit obtained from a car year-wise.
